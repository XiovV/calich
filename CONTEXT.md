# Calendar

Domain vocabulary for the calendar app — navigation chrome, view state, and the sidebar calendar list.

## Language

**Active view**:
The granularity at which the calendar is currently displayed — Day, Week, Month, or Year. Drives the main content grid (later) and the top bar's date label format.
_Avoid_: mode, display mode

**Selected date**:
The single date the shell is currently focused on, shown in the mini calendar and driving the main grid. Distinct from "today" — navigating away doesn't change what "today" means.
_Avoid_: current date, active date

**Calendar**:
A named, colored, independently-toggleable collection that groups events (e.g. "Work", "Personal"). Not the app itself, and not the view/grid.
_Avoid_: calendar list item, source

**Event**:
A titled time block belonging to a single Calendar, with a start, an end, and zero or more Reminders. Rendered on the grid in its Calendar's color.
_Avoid_: appointment, meeting, entry

**Draft block**:
A proposed time window for a not-yet-saved Event, before it is confirmed via the creation modal — whether it originated from dragging on the grid or from a default (e.g. the sidebar's Create button). Discarded, not saved, if the modal is cancelled.
_Avoid_: pending event, temp event

**Reminder**:
A minutes-before-start offset attached to an Event, chosen from a fixed preset list (not free-form).
_Avoid_: notification, alert

**Day cell**:
A single day's box in the Month view grid. Holds that day's Event chips and is the target of create-clicks and drag-to-move drops.
_Avoid_: day box, tile

**Event chip**:
The compact, single-line rendering of an Event inside a Day cell, drawn in its Calendar's color and showing start time and title. The Month-view counterpart to the grid's timed event block.
_Avoid_: pill, event bar

**Adjacent-month day**:
A Day cell belonging to the month before or after the one being displayed, shown to fill the fixed six-row grid. Rendered dimmed but fully live — its Events show, and it accepts creates, edits, and drops like any other Day cell.
_Avoid_: overflow day, padding day, out-of-month day

**Mini-month**:
A compact, read-only month shown in the Year view — day numbers only, no Event chips. One of twelve laid out in a grid.
_Avoid_: month thumbnail, small calendar

**Event-presence dot**:
The marker on a Mini-month day indicating it has at least one visible Event. A density hint only — it carries no Calendar color and no count.
_Avoid_: event indicator, badge

**Theme preference**:
The user's chosen appearance — Light, Dark, or System — persisted locally and applied by toggling a `.dark` class on the document root. System defers to the OS setting; Light and Dark pin the appearance regardless of the OS. See ADR-0014.
_Avoid_: color scheme, mode, dark-mode toggle

## Authentication

**User**:
The account record a Session belongs to, validated by the backend. One per self-hosted instance today; see ADR-0010 for why the schema doesn't treat this as a singleton.
_Avoid_: account, profile

**Session**:
The logged-in state for one User, established by the backend after validating credentials. Present or absent — there is no partial/expired-but-visible session state in this app.
_Avoid_: login state, auth state

**Access token**:
The short-lived credential attached to authenticated requests, held in memory only on the client and re-obtained on page load via the Refresh token.
_Avoid_: auth token, bearer token

**Refresh token**:
The credential used to obtain a new Access token without re-entering credentials, via `refreshAccessToken`. Issued by the backend as an `httpOnly`, `Secure` cookie — see ADR-0009.
_Avoid_: renewal token

## Deployment

**Data directory**:
The single directory (`DATA_DIR`, default `/data`) under which the backend stores all persistent state — currently the SQLite database, and any future runtime data (backups, attachments). The one path a self-hoster needs to mount as a volume.
_Avoid_: data dir (in prose), storage path
